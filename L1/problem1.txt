Solution to e
Value of 'Home' -> /home/roy
Home directory is the base directory of a user. Different users have different home directory.

Solution to f
Value of 'Path' -> /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
Path direcotry signifies that the listed direcoties are directly accessible. Therefore, path is often used to store libaraies and applications that many programs share.

Solution to g
When hw1.sh is entered, bash tries to find hw1.sh in the directories listed in the path. However './hw1.sh' works because then bash looks for the file in the current directory, where the file is.

Solution to i
When `` is used instead of '', bash treats the string under `` as code, hence executing it and then uses the result as standard string.
So, when 'mkdir `whoami`' is initiated, first bash executes whoami, which gives the name of the current user and then it procedes to create a direcotry named on the user.

Solution to j
The first command searches for 'dog' in the file names in the specified directory.
Second one searches for 'dog' inside the files of the specified directory
